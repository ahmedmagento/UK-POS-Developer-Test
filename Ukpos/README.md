# Ahmed_Ukpos Module

## Overview

The `Ahmed_Ukpos` Magento 2 module enhances the checkout process by calculating the earliest possible delivery date for a selected delivery method. This helps customers know when they can expect their orders based on various configurable factors.

## Features

- **Delivery Date Calculation**: Calculates the earliest delivery date considering delivery and dispatch days, exceptions, and cut-off times.
- **Admin Configuration**:
  - **Delivery Days**: Specify which days of the week delivery is allowed (Weekdays, Saturday, Sunday).
  - **Delivery Exception Dates**: Define dates when delivery is not possible (e.g., public holidays).
  - **Delivery Time**: Set the number of days required for delivery after dispatch.
  - **Cut-Off Time**: Specify the cut-off time for same-day dispatch.

## Implementation Details

- **Current Implementation**:
  - The module currently supports two delivery methods: `Flat Rate` and `Free Shipping`.
  - Configurable fields for delivery days, exception dates, delivery time, and cut-off time have been added to the Magento Admin for both delivery methods.

- **Potential Improvements**:
  - **Dynamic Exception Dates**: The current implementation uses a simple text area for exception dates. An enhanced version could feature dynamic rows with two fields for each exception date:
    - **Date**: The specific exception date.
    - **Custom Message**: A customizable message explaining the reason for the exception (e.g., bank holiday, special closure) that can be displayed to customers.
  - **Order Details**: Enhance the module to submit the calculated delivery date with each order. This data could be used in the Magento Admin area to sort and manage orders based on their expected delivery dates.

## Installation

1. **Install the Module**:
   - Place the module directory in `app/code/Ahmed/Ukpos`.

2. **Enable the Module**:
   - Execute the following commands:
     ```bash
     php bin/magento module:enable Ahmed_Ukpos
     php bin/magento setup:upgrade
     php bin/magento setup:di:compile
     php bin/magento cache:clean
     ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Navigate to `Stores > Configuration > Sales > Shipping Methods` in the Magento Admin panel.
   - Configure the delivery settings for each delivery method under the `Flat Rate` and `Free Shipping` sections.

## Usage

1. **Delivery Date Calculation**:
   - The module will automatically calculate and append the earliest delivery date to the shipping method title during checkout.
   - Ensure that the configuration values are correctly set in the Admin to reflect accurate delivery dates.

2. **Testing**:
   - Test different scenarios by placing orders at various times, with different configurations, and on different days of the week to ensure accuracy.
